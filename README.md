## Flipkart Grid Challenge - Social Media Data Extraction and Product Matching
Overview
This project was developed as part of the Flipkart Grid Challenge. The primary goal was to extract trending product data from various social media platforms and determine if these items were available on Flipkart. If a match was found, the project's system would retrieve and display the details of the item.

Challenge Description
The challenge was structured around the following key objectives:

Data Extraction: Scrape trending product information from popular social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. The focus was on categories such as clothing (e.g., shirts, dresses, jeans), accessories (e.g., belts, sunglasses), and footwear.

Product Matching: Analyze the extracted data to identify if the same or similar items were available on Flipkart. If a match was found, the details of the item were to be retrieved and displayed.

## Work Done
Data Scraping
Social Media Platforms: Data was scraped from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, focusing on trending fashion items. Various attributes such as product type, brand, color, and style were extracted.
Machine Learning Model
Product Identification: A custom machine learning model was developed to classify and identify specific product types with a high degree of accuracy. The model achieved an accuracy of 94.3% in correctly identifying and categorizing products based on the data scraped from social media.

Algorithm Details: The model leveraged natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition techniques to analyze and categorize products. Emphasis was placed on training the model with diverse datasets to enhance its ability to accurately identify product types and match them to available items on Flipkart.

Product Matching on Flipkart
Search and Matching: Using advanced scraping tools, the identified products were searched on Flipkart's platform. The system was able to successfully locate matching items based on the extracted product attributes.

Displaying Results: Once a match was found, the details of the item (such as price, availability, and customer reviews) were retrieved and displayed on the original social media platform (e.g., Facebook).

Webpage Development
Flipkart Clone: A user-friendly web interface was developed that mimicked the layout and functionality of Flipkart. This clone was used to display the matched products and their details in a format similar to the Flipkart platform, providing users with a seamless shopping experience.

## Results
The system was able to successfully extract, classify, and match trending products from social media platforms with an accuracy of 97.23%.
The Flipkart clone interface provided a smooth and intuitive experience for users to view and explore matched products.
## Future Work
Expand Social Media Sources: Incorporate more platforms such as Pinterest and TikTok to capture a broader range of trending products.
Enhance Model Accuracy: Further refine the machine learning model to improve accuracy, particularly in more nuanced product categories.
Automate Continuous Data Extraction: Develop automated processes for continuous data extraction and real-time product matching.
